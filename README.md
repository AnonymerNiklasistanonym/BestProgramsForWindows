# BestProgramsForWindows

List of all the programs I would install if I ever build a new computer with Windows, reset my existing Windows computer or if somebody asks me with which program he should do x on Windows. (Many programs on this list are cross platform - this means there is a high chance even as a Linux user you could find here a good program - in future updates I will probably add a tag if this is the case)

---

Supported tags (always in this order):

- `open source` - The code of the software is hosted online and can be viewed by anyone which means if there are any back doors/bugs/privacy issues anyone can flag or discover them
- `linux` / `linux+mac` / `mac` - The same software is also available on the named desktop platforms
- `64bit` - The program supports more than 4GB of RAM and can be better for professional or heavy use
- `~XXMB/GB` - The size of the installed program (Important fo users who only have limited storage size)
