# BestProgramsForWindows

List of all the programs I would install if I ever build a new computer with Windows, reset my existing Windows computer or if somebody asks me with which program he should do x on Windows. (Many programs on this list are cross platform - this means there is a high chance even as a Linux user you could find here a good program - in future updates I will probably add a tag if this is the case)
